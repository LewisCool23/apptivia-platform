## 🎨 UI Indicators

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **"3/5 selected"** | You've picked 3 out of 5 needed KPIs |
| 🟢 Green banner | Perfect! All 5 selected |
| 🟡 Yellow banner | No KPIs selected yet |
| 🔵 Blue banner | Need more KPIs (less than 5) |
| **Position #1-5** | Display order on scorecard |

## 💡 Tips for Choosing KPIs

### Balanced Approach:
- **2 Activity Metrics** → Leading indicators (calls, emails, dials)
- **1 Engagement Metric** → Mid-funnel (meetings, demos)
- **2 Pipeline/Revenue Metrics** → Lagging indicators (opportunities, revenue)

### Best Practices:
✅ Choose metrics aligned with your team's OKRs
✅ Mix leading and lagging indicators
✅ Select metrics your reps can directly influence
✅ Review and adjust quarterly

❌ Don't choose only lagging indicators
❌ Avoid metrics outside rep control
❌ Don't overcomplicate with too many categories
